# teradicislider

When connecting to a Teradici session for the first time after a machine reboot, you must Connect, Disconnect, and then Connect again for Teradici Slider to work.  This is not on us, this is a Teradici bug.   After that, it will work normally until PCoIP Agent is restarted, or the machine is rebooted.
